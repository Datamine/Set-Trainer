# Set Trainer

In-browser, single-player version of the card game [Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28game%29).
Read the documentation [here](http://www.johnloeber.com/docs/set.html) or play the game [here](http://www.johnloeber.com/set).

## Todo

Even though I currently consider this project finished, following are some things I could do to improve it.

- Striped texture instead of low opacity on the cards
- add a "hint" button (I'm not convinced that this would actually be a worthwhile feature.)
- add difficulty settings
- finish writing a better subset generation algorithm for the step in which we check for presence of a set (draft in Subset.elm)
- refactor code and express sets in terms of integer-valued vectors for easier computations
- animations, perhaps?
- use the graphics of the actual Set game (the 3 shapes being oval, tilde, and diamond)
- add a timer
- insert cookies to save sessions
    - add a reset button to reset the session
- multiplayer mode
